# Coronary
Coronary artery segmentation in X-R angiograms with VTK for visualization.

Segmentation of coronary arteries is carried out in two main steps: detection, and segmentation.
The detection step enchances elongated and thin structures in the image.
The segmetnation step uses a thresholding technique to differentiate between vessel pixels and background, based on the result obtained from the detection step.
